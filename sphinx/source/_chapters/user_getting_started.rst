Shipping the package as part of another project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since this package is lightweight, an alternative is to simply download it and ship it as a dependency (lib) to your
project.Download the repo code as a `zip`, store it somewhere locally in your project's directory, commit it,
and add it to the requirements.
